# Ena
ðŸ‘· A Paper plugin to enable some features on my server.

### What is Ena?

A few friends and I were looking to setup a server to play on.
Instead of installing a bunch of plugins we wanted to keep it simple, so Ena was born.
Ena has some simple commands to use and nothing else. This most likely isn't what you're looking for.

### Using Ena

Sadly at the minute, there's no builds for Ena. They'll come soon!
For now though, to get started with Ena, clone the project and restore the project using Gradle.
You can then use the `build->jar` task to produce a jar you can drag into your plugins folder.
